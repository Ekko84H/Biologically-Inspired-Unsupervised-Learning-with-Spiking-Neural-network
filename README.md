# Biologically-Inspired-Unsupervised-Learning-with-Spiking-Neural-network

Addressed the inefficiency of traditional neural network models by aiming to implement energy-efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs) on FPGAs. Used STDP learning and the Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) neuron model to develop a biologically inspired SNN. Simulated spike-based learning in Verilog, encoded real-world datasets into spike trains, and debugged timing inconsistencies to validate output neuron specialization.
